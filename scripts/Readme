Generating pfb using Metapost and FontForge
-------------------------------------------

1) apply 'patch_mf_sources' 
2) run 'convert-fonts.sh'. This generates eps files for each glyph
   in the 'source' directory
3) install a recent version of FontForge.
   run 
     for i in "" "-Bold"
     do 
       for j in 5 6 7 8 9 10 12
       do 
         ./mkMn.ff $j $i 2>&1 | grep -v showpage
         ./postprocess.ff $j $i
       done
     done
   
   This generates the sfd and pfb files in the scripts directory. If 
   in the meantime some extra glyphs have been added to MnSymbol, 
   make sure to adapt in 'postprocess.ff' the line
     Select("NameMe.209","NameMe.255.1");
     DetachAndRemoveGlyphs();
   so that no 'NameMe' glyphs remain after postprocessing.
   Then check each pfb that modified glyphs render correctly, in
   particular with respect to open and intersecting paths.
4) run
     mkdir final
     for i in *.pfb
     do 
       t1disasm $i | gawk -f packsubr.awk | t1asm -b > final/$i
     done
5) For generating an otf version using AFDKO 2.0, copy the final pfb 
   into the according afdko subdirectories and in each run
     makeotf -r -addn -f MnSymbol<size>.pfb
   and for the bold fonts
     makeotf -r -addn -b -f MnSymbol-Bold<size>.pfb
